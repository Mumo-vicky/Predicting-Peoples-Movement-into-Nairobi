# Predicting-Peoples-Movement-into-Nairobi
The goal of the project is to build a model that predicts the number of seats that Mobiticket can expect to sell for each ride for a specific route on a specific date and time.

# Project Description
Mobiticket is a travel technology company that provides a service that enables one to book, pay and get bus tickets using your phone. According to CNBC Africa Nairobi is one of the most heavily congested cities in Africa. With people moving in and out of Nairobi frequently, there is bound to be traffic congestion.

The data to be used was provided by Mobiticket and had 14 columns. Some of the important columns include; ride_id, travel_date, travel_time, travel_from, travel_to, car_type, max_capacity. A new column ‘number_of_tickets’ that counts the number of tickets sold per ride_id that will be used as our target variable to predict people’s movement in Nairobi.
